=head2 create an "nsupdate" script from DNS zone file differences

The B<nsdiff> program examines the old and new versions of a DNS zone,
and outputs the differences as a script for use by BIND's B<nsupdate>
program. It provides a bridge between static zone files and dynamic
updates.

The B<nspatch> script is a wrapper around C<`nsdiff | nsupdate`> that
checks and reports errors in a manner suitable for running from B<cron>.

The B<nsvi> script makes it easy to edit a dynamic zone.

If you use BIND 9.7 or 9.8, you can use B<nsdiff> as an alternative
to the DNSSEC C<inline-signing> feature which appeared in BIND 9.9.
The server updates the DNSSEC records dynamically, but you can
continue to manage the unsigned static zone file as before and use
C<`nsdiff | nsupdate`> to push changes to the server.

There are other situations where you have a zone which is partly
dynamic and partly static, for example, a reverse DNS zone mostly
updated by a DHCP server, which also has a few static entries. You can
use B<nsdiff> to update the static part of the zone.

=head2 Dependencies

To run nsdiff you need perl-5.10 or newer, and BIND version 9.7 or
newer, specifically the B<dig>, B<named-compilezone>, and B<nsupdate>
utilities.
